Some of my research work. THis was a project aimed at identifying astronomical objects that have high probability of being astronomical lenses from a pool of millions of low-resolution images.
Thie goal of this project was to find a way to utilize very small (couple hundred) sample of already classified objects to train neural networks that would filter out immages of objects that are
deffinitely not good candidates and thus save time and monehy for astronomers when checking those objects using telescopes. Goal was to filter out around 90% of bad candidates. Sicnce the amoun of
classified objects is very small  just a regular classifier will not produce adecvate results so this project utilzes convolutional autoencoders to create more features for XGBoost classifier to use
when making final classifications. Files include Model training scripts, XGBoost classifier training scripts, entire image proccesing and classification pipeline
